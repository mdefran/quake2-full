### Dark Souls Mod for Quake 2

This mod adds certain features from Dark Souls to Quake 2. The following features have been implemented:

- Third-Person: Press 'c' to toggle third-person mode.
- Souls: Kill enemies to earn souls. When you die, you will drop your souls. You can collect the souls you dropped during your last death by walking up to them.
- Bonfires: Placed throughout the level, bonfires allow you to upgrade your stats in exchange for souls. Walk up to one and open the terminal for further details.

Deliverables:

- Replace all of Quake's weapons with weapons from my favorite Souls game
- Souls mechanic (collecting souls; dropping on death; leaving a bloodstain)
- 3rd person camera
- Camera lock on
- Stats that will be improved at a bonfire

To install the mod, do the following:

Navigate to your Steam installation of Quake 2. Typically, this can be found at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Quake 2`. Once there, paste in the "souls" folder from above.

To add a shortcut to launch the mod, create a desktop shortcut for the Quake 2 executable. Then, right click it and edit the properties. In the "Target" section, add `+set game "souls"` to the end. You can then launch the mod using the created shortcut.
